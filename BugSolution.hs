The solution involves avoiding the direct application of `length` to an infinite list. Instead, we use techniques like taking a finite prefix using `take` or employing lazy evaluation safely.  This version demonstrates using `take` to limit the length calculation to a manageable size.

```haskell
import Data.List (iterate)

-- Corrected version:
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let infiniteList = iterate (+1) 1
  let finiteList = take 10 infiniteList -- Take the first 10 elements
  print (length finiteList)
```
